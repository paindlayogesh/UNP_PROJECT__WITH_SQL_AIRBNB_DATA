# UNP_PROJECT__WITH_SQL_AIRBNB_DATA

During a team project at UNP Education, we worked with the AdventureWorks dataset to improve our SQL skills and understand how databases work. We explored the existing database structure and also created new tables and columns where needed. We added primary keys, foreign keys, set data types, and applied constraints to keep the data accurate and organized. Using SQL Workbench, we inserted the given data and performed various queries to get useful information. These queries included using JOINs, subqueries, aggregate functions, and filters to analyze data related to sales, customers, and products. This project gave us hands-on experience with real-world database tasks and helped us learn how to handle and analyze data effectively.
